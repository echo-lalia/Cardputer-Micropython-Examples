# Cardputer-Micropython-Examples
This is just a collection of very basic demos for the M5Stack Cardputer (M5Stamp-S3) which were written in MicroPython. 

The demos range from  useful drivers, to extremely basic proof of concept scripts. These are not all going to be super useful, but hopefully they can help you get started :)
